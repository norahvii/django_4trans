## About the project:

A lot of people don't know what electrolysis is, or that it's painful, or that it's expensive. It can be a barrier for some trans women and girls transitioning. The intent with this project was to create a professional-looking home page to inform the public about these issues. It's information only and has a balanced design, and it's mobile ready thanks to Bootstrap. Subtle CSS design choices are pink hover animations and having the acordian menus turn black to create visual hierarchy.
